# math-playground 🧮
Here are some calculus assigments, exercises, algorithms which i've done in 2020 while studying at College

# Subjects 📚📋
* [Discrete Math](#Discrete-Math-💖 "Goto Discrete Math 💖") 
   * [Sets](#Sets-Calculator-🖩 "Goto Sets Calculator 🖩")
* [Numerical Analysis](#Numerical-Analysis-📊 "Goto Numerical Analysis 📊")
   * [Regression](#Regression-📉 "Goto Regression 📉")

# Discrete Math 💖
# Sets Calculator 🖩
Made this app to learn more about sets structure<br>
Logic in Python, GUI in Tkinter<br>

# Numerical Analysis 📊
# Regression 📉
This is a simple linear Regression solved with [Least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) method<br>
Where: 
* x - is the exam preparation time
* y - is the student mark
* φ - is the estimated mark
* Σ - is the sum and 1/nΣ is an avg sum
* Ɛ - is an [observational error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_error)

Used [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) to beatify the output
